#  Project: Coin Flip

### Goal: Create a coin flip game!

This Coin Flip game allows the user to press the flip button to initiate the animation for heads or tails. Instead of a Coin though I used an image of a AMD 5950X Proccessor because I love computers and I thought this would be cool. The app will keep count of the score. The user currrently has to press the reset button after each press in order for the processor to flip.
